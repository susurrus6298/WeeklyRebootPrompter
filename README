Deploy the .intunewin file (win32 app) via Intune. Install in user context.
Use the presence of "C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\Weekly Reboot Prompt" as the detection rule.
Modify the prompt message in userReboot.ps1 if desired. Take away the Cancel button if you like.
Deploys via creating a scheduled task that runs as the current user (app was installed in
the user context), prompts the user to reboot, and bugs them each day that they have not
yet rebooted. Time is set as weekly by way of the calculation found in userReboot.ps1 which runs
daily at 3pm within the user's timezone. Obviously, if you modify the scripts then you must
recreate the .intunewin file using the appropriate Microsoft win32 app creation tool.
